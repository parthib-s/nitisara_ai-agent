However, it is the slowest.\n    *   **Estimated Transit Time:** Approximately 18-25 days.\n\n*   **\u26a1 Express Sea:**\n    *   **Trade-offs:** Offers a balance between cost and speed (\u20b917,272,687). It's faster than Economy Sea but still significantly more economical and environmentally friendly than Air Freight. The CO\u2082e footprint is the same as Economy Sea (35.46t CO\u2082e).\n    *   **Estimated Transit Time:** Approximately 12-18 days.\n\n*   **\u2708\ufe0f Air Freight:**\n    *   **Trade-offs:** This is the fastest option, ideal for urgent shipments. However, it is significantly more expensive (\u20b9108,062,730) and has a much higher carbon footprint (673.74t CO\u2082e) compared to sea freight.\n    *   **Estimated Transit Time:** Approximately 3-5 days.\n\nWhich option aligns best with your priorities, or would you like to proceed with a booking?"
